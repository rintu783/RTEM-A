Real Time Energy Monitoring &amp; Automation

Most of the time, a lot of energy in domestic households is wasted because of negligence rather than heavy/unnecessary usage. This excess usage of energy can be countered in 
two different ways - (i) by introducing a penalty to the end-consumer for the excess
electricity used, and (ii} by enabling the consumer to track their daily energy use patterns
and corresponding expenditure incurred. Such an arrangement will make people more
cautious and careful about energy spending and at the same time, allows the flexibility to
tailor ones’ electricity needs according to the limits allowed by the system. However, both
these steps towards an energy efficient scenario for domestic households require an
effective monitoring system, an adept policy framework, and implementation method. Even
though there have been prior attempts to bring about energy efficiency in domestic
households in Kerala, they have always suffered from a single drawback — the solutions
proposed till date required the end electricity consumers to install/change/adapt to a new
technology. it is in this scenario that the solutions that we propose for effective energy
monitoring and awareness for domestic households assume significance.

Our solution consists of a simple add-on to the existing kWh meter in a house (without
disturbing the wiring system or connecting to each individual appliance), and a mobile app
that is very versatile and dynamic in its applications. A module consisting of a current transformer and IoT chip, attached to the kWh meter of a house will act as a real time energy monitoring device - which is connected to the consumer by way of the mobile app. The mobile app can effectively monitor the power consumption and predict the monthly usage and cost. It can also set monthly usage targets, with proper notifications and warnings. The most important
feature of the application is that, based on the current power consumption pattern, it can
predict whether by the end of the month, it will exceed the set usage limits. Depending on
with this information, the consumer can cut down on his power consumption.

A proper policy scheme can also be developed through governmental intervention. For
instance, for those consumers who achieve a certain monthly target, reward points/scratch
and win coupons can be given which, if accumulated enough can be redeemed while paying
the electricity bills through the same app. The reward scheme can also be varied depending
on the number of people in the household. The app can also be setup to send notifications
regarding the bill due date.

As the module is connected to the internet 24 x 7 through the loT chip, a substation can
easily monitor the real time electricity usage of a section. Similarly, the peak electricity
usage time can be monitored effectively. Moreover, the identification of connection error in
transmission lines will be easier, as every module is connected to the internet, the houses in
an area without electricity can be easily identified, thereby sorting out the problem quickly.
Right now, for any electricity related query/repair, the consumer has to directly contact the
electricity department of the state (KSEB). With the help of the mobile app as proposed in
In this study, KSEB can directly monitor electricity consumption and act fast. The app will
also be equipped with a ‘complaints’ portal, where the consumers can lodge complaints and
track the status of their complaint.
